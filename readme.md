FTP-Account to UserMeta
=======================

This WordPress-Plugin stores the ftp-account data of a single user in the usermeta. This prevent to insert the ftp-account data everytime WordPress need them.
It also make it possible to use more than one ftp-user on the same WordPress-Installation.

Kudos
